# **Smart Grid Energy Scheduling Optimization**

## **Overview**

This project implements a smart grid energy scheduling system based on the paper *["Smart Grid Energy Scheduling Based on Improved Dynamic Programming Algorithm and LSTM"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10403179/)*. The goal is to optimize energy distribution in smart grids by combining an improved dynamic programming algorithm with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Programming Optimization:** Efficiently schedules energy resources to minimize costs and maximize efficiency.
- **LSTM Networks:** Predicts future energy demands to enhance scheduling accuracy.
- **Smart Grid Focus:** Tailored to improve energy management in smart grid systems.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-grid-energy-scheduling.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd smart-grid-energy-scheduling
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

1. Run the main script to start the energy scheduling process:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Modify the configuration files as needed to adjust parameters for your specific use case.
